# Toxic-Comment-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes-LDA-and-Neutral-Networks

In the first part of the project, we constructed a model with Multinomial Navie Bayes Classifier to investigate the document (comment) classification problem. Then, we constructed 5 neural networks with different mechanisms. Lastly, we apply both approaches to the real-world testing data and evaluate their performance. 

In the second part of this project, we applied both Multinomial Navie Bayes Classifier and neural network to synthetic data generated by the Multinomial Navie Bayes model. We evaluated the results qualitatively and quantitatively. Situations where each approach performs well and poorly were highlighted.

Note: 
- The data used in the project comes from [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).
- Python packages used in the project [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
